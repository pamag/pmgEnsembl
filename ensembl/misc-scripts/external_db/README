EXTERNAL_DB UPDATES
===================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The external_db table contains a list of all external databases which are
referenced by ensembl.  Specifically this table is used by the xref table
which contains lists of external database identifiers.

Foremerly all EnsEMBL core databases had their own external_db tables
and used an enumeration of db_names.  This was difficult to maintain and
required schema updates every release.  The new system requires that 
every ensembl database contains the exact same external_db table, which
ensures consistancy across all databases and makes it easier to test.

MASTER EXTERNAL_DB LIST
-----------------------

The master list of external databases is stored in the file:

${ENSEMBL_HOME}/ensembl/misc-scripts/external_db/external_dbs.txt

This file contains a tab-seperated list of values which are loaded into
the external_db tables.  In order the columns are:
 'external_db_id', 'db_name', 'release', 'status',
'db_primary_acc_linkable', 'display_label_linkable', 'priority',
'db_display_name', 'type', 'secondary_db_name', 'secondary_db_table',
'description'

- external_db_id -- internal identifier for this entry, primary key
- release -- is currently not used by the software and is always set to 1
- status -- must be one of 'KNOWNXREF','KNOWN', 'XREF', 'PRED', 'ORTH', 'PSEUDO'.  
This is used by the webcode to determine which genes/transcripts can be considered 
to be known or unknown etc.
- dbprimary_acc_linkable -- used by the webcode to indicate if the linkable
element is the internal name in the database (e.g. HGNC_curated_gene)
- display_label_linkable -- used by the webcode to indicate if the linkable
element is the name of the database (e.g. WikiGene )
- priority -- used for the website to indicate priority of display in page
( the higher the number, the closer to the top of the page)
- db_display_name -- name to be displayed in the website might be different
to name of database (e.g. HGNC Symbol rather than HGNC)
- type -- indicates kind of information the xref database offers (e.g. ALT_GENE
is used in OTTG to indicate that this external database produces alternative gene from Vega)
- secondary_db_name -- not used at the moment (requested by functional genomics team)
- secondary_db_table -- not used at the moment (requested by functiona genomics team)
- description -- free column to describe the external database

UPDATE PROCEDURE
----------------

The following describes the steps necessary to update the external_db table


(1) Add new external database(s) if the appropriate database(s) are not in the
master list:
   (a) Add a row to the external_dbs.txt file.  The columns must be tab
       seperated and the external_db identifier must be unique.  The 
       db_release should be set to 1 and the status should reflect the 
       how xrefs from this external database are used by web.

       For example a new external_db 'Celera_gene' could be added as the 
       following:

       400	Celera_Gene	1	PRED	1	0	5	Celera gene	MISC	\N	\N

   (b) Commit the external_dbs.txt file using cvs commit.  This is to 
       ensure that nobody else who may also be updating the file will use
       the same identifier that you chose (in the example ID 400).




(2) Propagate the contents of the file to all of the core style databases
(core|cdna|vega|otherfeatures). To update all of the core style databases 
for release  56:

perl update_external_dbs.pl -host ens-staging -file external_dbs.txt \
                              -user ensadmin -pass secret -release 56

To update the human core database:

perl update_external_dbs.pl -host ens-staging -file external_dbs.txt \
                              -user ensadmin -pass secret -dbnames homo_sapiens_core_56_37a

Upon executing the script it will display a list of dbs that the updates
will be applied and you will have to type 'yes' at a confirmation.

If the databases to be updated contain rows that are not in the file, 
a warning will be given and the database in question skipped.

The flag -nonreleasemode it is used when we we want to load the master
database (use in combination with -master): e.g. we want to create a new
database with all the external_db from the file

The flag -force is used to update the databases even there is a difference
between the master file and the databases. This should only be used when
we are sure the data in the database is wrong/not necessary and we want to
overwrite it with the information in the external_db.txt file.

In Ensembl, the release coordinator is responsible for running this script
during the release process.
