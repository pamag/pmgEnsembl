pmgEnsembl
==========

Ensembl local checkout and modified for the PMG (Perl Medical Genetics) modules:
  pmGWAS (perl modules for GWAS)
  pmNGS  (perl modules for ngs) 


Basically this is a clone of the ensembl CVS but kept in git so
finding diffs between releases that can affect pmg modules becomes
fast and trivial.
